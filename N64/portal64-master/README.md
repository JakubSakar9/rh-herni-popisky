# Portal64

A demake of Portal for the Nintendo 64.

## How to build

First, you will need to setup [Modern SDK](https://crashoveride95.github.io/n64hbrew/modernsdk/startoff.html).

Next, you will need to download Blender 3.0 or higher. Then set the environment variable `BLENDER_3_0` to be the absolute path where the Blender executable is located on your system.

<br />

You will need to install Python `vpk`.
```
pip install vpk
```

<br />

Install `vtf2png`, `sfz2n64`, and `skeletool64`.
```sh
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://lambertjamesd.github.io/apt/ ./" \
    | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/lambertjamesd.list

sudo apt install vtf2png sfz2n64 skeletool64 mpg123
```

<br />

Install ImageMagick.
```
sudo apt install imagemagick
```

<br />

You then need to add the following files from where Portal is installed to the folder `vpk`.
```
portal_pak_000.vpk  
portal_pak_001.vpk  
portal_pak_002.vpk  
portal_pak_003.vpk  
portal_pak_004.vpk  
portal_pak_005.vpk  
portal_pak_dir.vpk
```

Finally, run `make` to build the project.

<br />


## Build with Docker


Build the Docker image.
```
docker build . -t portal64
```

<br />

Then build.
```sh
# Set the environment variable
BLENDER_3_0=/blender/blender

# Build using docker
docker run \
    -v /home/james/Blender/blender-2.93.1-linux-x64:/blender \
    -e BLENDER_3_0 -v /home/james/portal/portal64/vpk:/usr/src/app/vpk \
    -t -v /home/james/portal/portal64/docker-output:/usr/src/app/build portal64
```

<br />

Where `/home/james/Blender/blender-2.93.1-linux-x64` is the folder where Blender is located.

`/home/james/portal/portal64/vpk` is the folder where the portal `*.vpk` files are located.

`/home/james/portal/portal64/docker-output` is where you want the output of the build to locate `portal.z64` will be put into this folder.
